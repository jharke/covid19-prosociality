          Save the Children - 100 Years Working With Children
        </b>
      </h5>

      <p>
        At the beginning of the 20th century, two sisters had a vision
        to protect children and their rights. 100 years later, Save
        the Children is still fighting to give children a healthy
        start in life, the chance to learn and protection from harm.
      </p>

      <p>
        Around the world and in the UK, too many children still start
        life at a disadvantage simply because of who they are and
        where they are from.
      </p>

      <p>
        Save the Children has a bold ambition: we believe that all
        children could thrive, have the chance to learn, and be
        protected from abuse, neglect and exploitation.
      </p>

      {% if player.treatment_covid %}
      <p>
        The coronavirus is already having devastating consequences for
        children and their rights. Health systems, both in poor
        countries and the NHS, are being overwhelmed. Children have
        had their education disrupted by school closures. Many face
        the prospect of poverty.
      </p>

      <p>
        With the pandemic now spreading into some of the world's
        poorest countries and in the UK, there is a real danger that
        we will see a reversal of the gains made over the last 20
        years. There is an alternative.
